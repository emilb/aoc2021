[1;31m--- Day 2: Dive! ---
[0mNow, you need to figure out how to [0mpilot this thing[0m.

[0mIt seems like the
submarine can take a series of commands like [0mforward 1[0m, [0mdown 2[0m, or [0mup 3[0m:

[0m
[0m[0mforward
X[0m increases the horizontal position by [0mX[0m units.[0m
[0m[0mdown X[0m [1;32mincreases[0m the depth
by [0mX[0m units.[0m
[0m[0mup X[0m [1;32mdecreases[0m the depth by [0mX[0m units.[0m
[0m
[0mNote that since you're
on a submarine, [0mdown[0m and [0mup[0m affect your [1;32mdepth[0m, and so they have the opposite
result of what you might expect.

[0mThe submarine seems to already have a
planned course (your puzzle input). You should probably figure out where
it's going. For example:

[0m[0mforward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward
2
[0m[0m
[0mYour horizontal position and depth both start at [0m0[0m. The steps above
would then modify them as follows:

[0m
[0m[0mforward 5[0m adds [0m5[0m to your horizontal
position, a total of [0m5[0m.[0m
[0m[0mdown 5[0m adds [0m5[0m to your depth, resulting in a value
of [0m5[0m.[0m
[0m[0mforward 8[0m adds [0m8[0m to your horizontal position, a total of [0m13[0m.[0m
[0m[0mup 3[0m
decreases your depth by [0m3[0m, resulting in a value of [0m2[0m.[0m
[0m[0mdown 8[0m adds [0m8[0m to
your depth, resulting in a value of [0m10[0m.[0m
[0m[0mforward 2[0m adds [0m2[0m to your horizontal
position, a total of [0m15[0m.[0m
[0m
[0mAfter following these instructions, you would
have a horizontal position of [0m15[0m and a depth of [0m10[0m. (Multiplying these
together produces [0m[1;32m150[0m[0m.)

[0mCalculate the horizontal position and depth you
would have after following the planned course. [1;32mWhat do you get if you multiply
your final horizontal position by your final depth?[0m
