[1;31m--- Day 7: The Treachery of Whales ---
[0mA giant [0mwhale[0m has decided your submarine is its next meal, and it's much
faster than you are. There's nowhere to run!

[0mSuddenly, a swarm of crabs
(each in its own tiny submarine - it's too deep for them otherwise) zooms
in to rescue you! They seem to be preparing to blast a hole in the ocean
floor; sensors indicate a [1;32mmassive underground cave system[0m just beyond where
they're aiming!

[0mThe crab submarines all need to be aligned before they'll
have enough power to blast a large enough hole for your submarine to get
through. However, it doesn't look like they'll be aligned before the whale
catches you! Maybe you can help?

[0mThere's one major catch - crab submarines
can only move horizontally.

[0mYou quickly make a list of [1;32mthe horizontal position
of each crab[0m (your puzzle input). Crab submarines have limited fuel, so
you need to find a way to make all of their horizontal positions match
while requiring them to spend as little fuel as possible.

[0mFor example,
consider the following horizontal positions:

[0m[0m16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14[0m[0m
[0mThis
means there's a crab with horizontal position [0m16[0m, a crab with horizontal
position [0m1[0m, and so on.

[0mEach change of 1 step in horizontal position of
a single crab costs 1 fuel. You could choose any horizontal position to
align them all on, but the one that costs the least fuel is horizontal
position [0m2[0m:

[0mMove from [0m14[0m to [0m2[0m: [0m12[0m fuel[0m
[0m
[0mThis costs a total of [0m[1;32m37[0m[0m fuel.
This is the cheapest possible outcome; more expensive outcomes include
aligning at position [0m1[0m ([0m41[0m fuel), position [0m3[0m ([0m39[0m fuel), or position [0m10[0m
([0m71[0m fuel).

[0mDetermine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to
using the least fuel possible. [1;32mHow much fuel must they spend to align to
that position?[0m
