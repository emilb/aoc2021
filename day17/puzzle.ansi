[1;31m--- Day 17: Trick Shot ---
[0mYou finally decode the Elves' message. [0m[0mHI[0m[0m, the message says. You continue
searching for the sleigh keys.

[0mAhead of you is what appears to be a large
[0mocean trench[0m. Could the keys have fallen into it? You'd better send a probe
to investigate.

[0mThe probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe
with any [0minteger[0m velocity in the [0mx[0m (forward) and [0my[0m (upward, or downward
if negative) directions. For example, an initial [0mx,y[0m velocity like [0m0,10[0m
would fire the probe straight up, while an initial velocity like [0m10,-1[0m
would fire the probe forward at a slight downward angle.

[0mThe probe's [0mx,y[0m
position starts at [0m0,0[0m. Then, it will follow some trajectory by moving
in [1;32msteps[0m. On each step, these changes occur in the following order:

[0m
[0mThe
probe's [0mx[0m position increases by its [0mx[0m velocity.[0m
[0mThe probe's [0my[0m position
increases by its [0my[0m velocity.[0m
[0mDue to drag, the probe's [0mx[0m velocity changes
by [0m1[0m toward the value [0m0[0m; that is, it decreases by [0m1[0m if it is greater than
[0m0[0m, increases by [0m1[0m if it is less than [0m0[0m, or does not change if it is already
[0m0[0m.[0m
[0mDue to gravity, the probe's [0my[0m velocity decreases by [0m1[0m.[0m
[0m
[0mFor the probe
to successfully make it into the trench, the probe must be on some trajectory
that causes it to be within a [1;32mtarget area[0m after any step. The submarine
computer has already calculated this target area (your puzzle input). For
example:

[0m[0mtarget area: x=20..30, y=-10..-5[0m[0m
[0mThis target area means that you
need to find initial [0mx,y[0m velocity values such that after any step, the
probe's [0mx[0m position is at least [0m20[0m and at most [0m30[0m, [1;32mand[0m the probe's [0my[0m position
is at least [0m-10[0m and at most [0m-5[0m.

[0mGiven this target area, one initial velocity
that causes the probe to be within the target area after any step is [0m7,2[0m:

[0m[0m
[0mIn
this diagram, [0mS[0m is the probe's initial position, [0m0,0[0m. The [0mx[0m coordinate
increases to the right, and the [0my[0m coordinate increases upward. In the bottom
right, positions that are within the target area are shown as [0mT[0m. After
each step (until the target area is reached), the position of the probe
is marked with [0m#[0m. (The bottom-right [0m#[0m is both a position the probe reaches
and a position in the target area.)

[0mAnother initial velocity that causes
the probe to be within the target area after any step is [0m6,3[0m:

[0m[0m
[0mThe
probe appears to pass through the target area, but is never within it after
any step. Instead, it continues down and to the right - only the first
few steps are shown.

[0mIf you're going to fire a highly scientific probe
out of a super cool probe launcher, you might as well do it with [1;32mstyle[0m.
How high can you make the probe go while still reaching the target area?

[0mIn
the above example, using an initial velocity of [0m6,9[0m is the best you can
do, causing the probe to reach a maximum [0my[0m position of [0m[1;32m45[0m[0m. (Any higher
initial [0my[0m velocity causes the probe to overshoot the target area entirely.)

[0mFind
the initial velocity that causes the probe to reach the highest [0my[0m position
and still eventually be within the target area after any step. [1;32mWhat is
the highest [0my[0m position it reaches on this trajectory?[0m
