[1;31m--- Day 13: Transparent Origami ---
[0mYou reach another volcanically active part of the cave. It would be nice
if you could do some kind of thermal imaging so you could tell ahead of
time which caves are too hot to safely enter.

[0mFortunately, the submarine
seems to be equipped with a thermal camera! When you activate it, you are
greeted with:

[0m[0mCongratulations on your purchase! To activate this infrared
thermal imaging
camera system, please enter the code found on page 1 of
the manual.
[0m[0m
[0mApparently, the Elves have never used this feature. To your
surprise, you manage to find the manual; as you go to open it, page 1 falls
out. It's a large sheet of [0mtransparent paper[0m! The transparent paper is
marked with random dots and includes instructions on how to fold it up
(your puzzle input). For example:

[0m[0m6,10
0,14
9,10
0,3
10,4
4,11
6,0
6,12

9,0

[0m[0m
[0mThe first section is a list of dots on the transparent
paper. [0m0,0[0m represents the top-left coordinate.  The first value, [0mx[0m, increases
to the right.  The second value, [0my[0m, increases downward.  So, the coordinate
[0m3,0[0m is to the right of [0m0,0[0m, and the coordinate [0m0,7[0m is below [0m0,0[0m. The coordinates
in this example form the following pattern, where [0m#[0m is a dot on the paper
and [0m.[0m is an empty, unmarked position:

[0m[0m...#..#..#.
....#......

[0m[0m
[0mThen,
there is a list of [1;32mfold instructions[0m. Each instruction indicates a line
on the transparent paper and wants you to fold the paper [1;32mup[0m (for horizontal
[0my=...[0m lines) or [1;32mleft[0m (for vertical [0mx=...[0m lines). In this example, the first
fold instruction is [0mfold along y=7[0m, which designates the line formed by
all of the positions where [0my[0m is [0m7[0m (marked here with [0m-[0m):

[0m[0m...#..#..#.

[0m[0m
[0mBecause
this is a horizontal line, fold the bottom half [1;32mup[0m. Some of the dots might
end up overlapping after the fold is complete, but dots will never appear
exactly on a fold line. The result of doing this fold looks like this:

[0m[0m#.##..#..#.
#...#......
......#...#
#...#......
.#.#..#.###
...........

[0m[0m
[0mNow,
only [0m17[0m dots are visible.

[0mNotice, for example, the two dots in the bottom
left corner before the transparent paper is folded; after the fold is complete,
those dots appear in the top left corner (at [0m0,0[0m and [0m0,1[0m). Because the
paper is transparent, the dot just below them in the result (at [0m0,3[0m) remains
visible, as it can be seen through the transparent paper.

[0mAlso notice that
some dots can end up [1;32moverlapping[0m; in this case, the dots merge together
and become a single dot.

[0mThe second fold instruction is [0mfold along x=5[0m,
which indicates this line:

[0m[0m#.##.|#..#.
#...#|.....
.....|#...#
#...#|.....
.#.#.|#.###
.....|.....
.....|.....
[0m[0m
[0mBecause
this is a vertical line, fold [1;32mleft[0m:

[0m[0m#####
#...#
#...#
#...#

.....
.....
[0m[0m
[0mThe
instructions made a square!

[0mThe transparent paper is pretty big, so for
now, focus on just completing the first fold. After the first fold in the
example above, [0m[1;32m17[0m[0m dots are visible - dots that end up overlapping after
the fold is completed count as a single dot.

[0m[1;32mHow many dots are visible
after completing just the first fold instruction on your transparent paper?[0m
