[1;31m--- Day 9: Smoke Basin ---
[0mThese caves seem to be [0mlava tubes[0m. Parts are even still volcanically active;
small hydrothermal vents release smoke into the caves that slowly [0msettles
like rain[0m.

[0mIf you can model how the smoke flows through the caves, you
might be able to avoid it and be that much safer. The submarine generates
a heightmap of the floor of the nearby caves for you (your puzzle input).

[0mSmoke
flows to the lowest point of the area it's in. For example, consider the
following heightmap:

[0m[0m2[1;32m1[0m9994321[1;32m0[0m
3987894921
98[1;32m5[0m6789892
8767896789
989996[1;32m5[0m678
[0m[0m
[0mEach
number corresponds to the height of a particular location, where [0m9[0m is the
highest and [0m0[0m is the lowest a location can be.

[0mYour first goal is to find
the [1;32mlow points[0m - the locations that are lower than any of its adjacent
locations. Most locations have four adjacent locations (up, down, left,
and right); locations on the edge or corner of the map have three or two
adjacent locations, respectively. (Diagonal locations do not count as adjacent.)

[0mIn
the above example, there are [1;32mfour[0m low points, all highlighted: two are
in the first row (a [0m1[0m and a [0m0[0m), one is in the third row (a [0m5[0m), and one
is in the bottom row (also a [0m5[0m). All other locations on the heightmap have
some lower adjacent location, and so are not low points.

[0mThe [1;32mrisk level[0m
of a low point is [1;32m1 plus its height[0m. In the above example, the risk levels
of the low points are [0m2[0m, [0m1[0m, [0m6[0m, and [0m6[0m. The sum of the risk levels of all
low points in the heightmap is therefore [0m[1;32m15[0m[0m.

[0mFind all of the low points
on your heightmap. [1;32mWhat is the sum of the risk levels of all low points
on your heightmap?[0m
