[1;31m--- Day 4: Giant Squid ---
[0mYou're already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean,
already so deep that you can't see any sunlight. What you [1;32mcan[0m see, however,
is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.

[0mMaybe
it wants to play [0mbingo[0m?

[0mBingo is played on a set of boards each consisting
of a 5x5 grid of numbers. Numbers are chosen at random, and the chosen
number is [1;32mmarked[0m on all boards on which it appears. (Numbers may not appear
on all boards.) If all numbers in any row or any column of a board are
marked, that board [1;32mwins[0m. (Diagonals don't count.)

[0mThe submarine has a [1;32mbingo
subsystem[0m to help passengers (currently, you and the giant squid) pass
the time. It automatically generates a random order in which to draw numbers
and a random set of boards (your puzzle input). For example:

[0m[0m7,4,9,5,11,17,23,2,0,14,21,24,10,16,13,6,15,25,12,22,18,20,8,19,3,26,1

[0mAt this point, the third board [1;32mwins[0m because it has
at least one complete row or column of marked numbers (in this case, the
entire top row is marked: [0m[1;32m14 21 17 24  4[0m[0m).

[0mThe [1;32mscore[0m of the winning board
can now be calculated. Start by finding the [1;32msum of all unmarked numbers[0m
on that board; in this case, the sum is [0m188[0m. Then, multiply that sum by
[1;32mthe number that was just called[0m when the board won, [0m24[0m, to get the final
score, [0m188 * 24 = [1;32m4512[0m[0m.

[0mTo guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure
out which board will win first. [1;32mWhat will your final score be if you choose
that board?[0m
