[1;31m--- Day 1: Sonar Sweep ---
[0mYou're minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard alarm
goes off! You rush to see if you can help. Apparently, one of the Elves
tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into the ocean!

[0mBefore
you know it, you're inside a submarine the Elves keep ready for situations
like this. It's covered in Christmas lights (because of course it is),
and it even has an experimental antenna that should be able to track the
keys if you can boost its signal strength high enough; there's a little
meter that indicates the antenna's signal strength by displaying 0-50 [1;33mstars[0m.

[0mYour
instincts tell you that in order to save Christmas, you'll need to get
all [1;33mfifty stars[0m by December 25th.

[0mCollect stars by solving puzzles.  Two
puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the
second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants
[1;33mone star[0m. Good luck!

[0mAs the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean,
it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small
screen, the sonar sweep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is
a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further
away from the submarine.

[0mFor example, suppose you had the following report:

[0m[0m199
200
208
210
200
207
240
269
260
263
[0m[0m
[0mThis
report indicates that, scanning outward from the submarine, the sonar sweep
found depths of [0m199[0m, [0m200[0m, [0m208[0m, [0m210[0m, and so on.

[0mThe first order of business
is to figure out how quickly the depth increases, just so you know what
you're dealing with - you never know if the keys will get [0mcarried into
deeper water[0m by an ocean current or a fish or something.

[0mTo do this, count
[1;32mthe number of times a depth measurement increases[0m from the previous measurement.
(There is no measurement before the first measurement.) In the example
above, the changes are as follows:

[0m[0m199 (N/A - no previous measurement)
200
([1;32mincreased[0m)
208 ([1;32mincreased[0m)
210 ([1;32mincreased[0m)
200 (decreased)
207 ([1;32mincreased[0m)
240
([1;32mincreased[0m)
269 ([1;32mincreased[0m)
260 (decreased)
263 ([1;32mincreased[0m)
[0m[0m
[0mIn this example,
there are [1;32m[0m7[0m[0m measurements that are larger than the previous measurement.

[0m[1;32mHow
many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?[0m
