[1;31m--- Day 6: Lanternfish ---
[0mThe sea floor is getting steeper. Maybe the sleigh keys got carried this
way?

[0mA massive school of glowing [0mlanternfish[0m swims past. They must spawn
quickly to reach such large numbers - maybe [1;32mexponentially[0m quickly? You
should model their growth rate to be sure.

[0mAlthough you know nothing about
this specific species of lanternfish, you make some guesses about their
attributes. Surely, [0meach lanternfish creates a new lanternfish[0m once every
[1;32m7[0m days.

[0mHowever, this process isn't necessarily synchronized between every
lanternfish - one lanternfish might have 2 days left until it creates another
lanternfish, while another might have 4. So, you can model each fish as
a single number that represents [1;32mthe number of days until it creates a new
lanternfish[0m.

[0mFurthermore, you reason, a [1;32mnew[0m lanternfish would surely need
slightly longer before it's capable of producing more lanternfish: two
more days for its first cycle.

[0mSo, suppose you have a lanternfish with
an internal timer value of [0m3[0m:

[0m
[0mAfter one day, its internal timer would
become [0m2[0m.[0m
[0mAfter another day, its internal timer would become [0m1[0m.[0m
[0mAfter another
day, its internal timer would become [0m0[0m.[0m
[0mAfter another day, its internal
timer would reset to [0m6[0m, and it would create a [1;32mnew[0m lanternfish with an internal
timer of [0m8[0m.[0m
[0mAfter another day, the first lanternfish would have an internal
timer of [0m5[0m, and the second lanternfish would have an internal timer of
[0m7[0m.[0m
[0m
[0mA lanternfish that creates a new fish resets its timer to [0m6[0m, [1;32mnot [0m7[0m[0m
(because [0m0[0m is included as a valid timer value). The new lanternfish starts
with an internal timer of [0m8[0m and does not start counting down until the
next day.

[0mRealizing what you're trying to do, the submarine automatically
produces a list of the ages of several hundred nearby lanternfish (your
puzzle input). For example, suppose you were given the following list:

[0m[0m3,4,3,1,2[0m[0m
[0mThis
list means that the first fish has an internal timer of [0m3[0m, the second fish
has an internal timer of [0m4[0m, and so on until the fifth fish, which has an
internal timer of [0m2[0m. Simulating these fish over several days would proceed
as follows:

[0m[0mInitial state: 3,4,3,1,2
After  1 day:  2,3,2,0,1
After  2
days: 1,2,1,6,0,8
After  3 days: 0,1,0,5,6,7,8
After  4 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,7,8,8
After
 5 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,7,7,8
After  6 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,7
After 
7 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6
After  8 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5
After  9
days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,8
After 10 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,7,8
After
11 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,0,1,1,2,6,7,8,8,8
After 12 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,0,0,1,5,6,7,7,7,8,8
After
13 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,0,4,5,6,6,6,7,7,8,8
After 14 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,7,7,8
After
15 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5,2,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,7
After 16 days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,8
After
17 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,7,8
After 18 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,0,1,1,2,6,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,6,7,8,8,8,8
[0m[0m
[0mEach
day, a [0m0[0m becomes a [0m6[0m and adds a new [0m8[0m to the end of the list, while each
other number decreases by 1 if it was present at the start of the day.

[0mIn
this example, after 18 days, there are a total of [0m26[0m fish. After 80 days,
there would be a total of [0m[1;32m5934[0m[0m.

[0mFind a way to simulate lanternfish. [1;32mHow
many lanternfish would there be after 80 days?[0m
