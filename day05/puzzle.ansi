[1;31m--- Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture ---
[0mYou come across a field of [0mhydrothermal vents[0m on the ocean floor! These
vents constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid
them if possible.

[0mThey tend to form in [1;32mlines[0m; the submarine helpfully produces
a list of nearby [0mlines of vents[0m (your puzzle input) for you to review.
For example:

[0m[0m0,9 -&gt; 5,9
8,0 -&gt; 0,8
9,4 -&gt; 3,4
2,2 -&gt; 2,1
7,0
-&gt; 7,4
6,4 -&gt; 2,0
0,9 -&gt; 2,9
3,4 -&gt; 1,4
0,0 -&gt; 8,8
5,5 -&gt;
8,2
[0m[0m
[0mEach line of vents is given as a line segment in the format [0mx1,y1
-&gt; x2,y2[0m where [0mx1[0m,[0my1[0m are the coordinates of one end the line segment
and [0mx2[0m,[0my2[0m are the coordinates of the other end. These line segments include
the points at both ends. In other words:

[0m
[0mAn entry like [0m1,1 -&gt; 1,3[0m covers
points [0m1,1[0m, [0m1,2[0m, and [0m1,3[0m.[0m
[0mAn entry like [0m9,7 -&gt; 7,7[0m covers points [0m9,7[0m,
[0m8,7[0m, and [0m7,7[0m.[0m
[0m
[0mFor now, [1;32monly consider horizontal and vertical lines[0m: lines
where either [0mx1 = x2[0m or [0my1 = y2[0m.

[0mSo, the horizontal and vertical lines
from the above list would produce the following diagram:

[0m[0m.......1..
..1....1..
..1....1..
.......1..
.112111211
..........
..........
..........
..........
222111....
[0m[0m
[0mIn
this diagram, the top left corner is [0m0,0[0m and the bottom right corner is
[0m9,9[0m. Each position is shown as [1;32mthe number of lines which cover that point[0m
or [0m.[0m if no line covers that point. The top-left pair of [0m1[0ms, for example,
comes from [0m2,2 -&gt; 2,1[0m; the very bottom row is formed by the overlapping
lines [0m0,9 -&gt; 5,9[0m and [0m0,9 -&gt; 2,9[0m.

[0mTo avoid the most dangerous areas,
you need to determine [1;32mthe number of points where at least two lines overlap[0m.
In the above example, this is anywhere in the diagram with a [0m2[0m or larger
- a total of [0m[1;32m5[0m[0m points.

[0mConsider only horizontal and vertical lines. [1;32mAt
how many points do at least two lines overlap?[0m
