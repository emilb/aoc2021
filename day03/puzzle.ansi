[1;31m--- Day 3: Binary Diagnostic ---
[0mThe submarine has been making some [0modd creaking noises[0m, so you ask it to
produce a diagnostic report just in case.

[0mThe diagnostic report (your puzzle
input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly,
can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine.
The first parameter to check is the [1;32mpower consumption[0m.

[0mYou need to use
the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new binary
numbers (called the [1;32mgamma rate[0m and the [1;32mepsilon rate[0m). The power consumption
can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.

[0mEach
bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the [1;32mmost common bit
in the corresponding position[0m of all numbers in the diagnostic report.
For example, given the following diagnostic report:

[0m[0m00100
11110
10110
10111
10101
01111
00111
11100
10000
11001
00010
01010
[0m[0m
[0mConsidering
only the first bit of each number, there are five [0m0[0m bits and seven [0m1[0m bits.
Since the most common bit is [0m1[0m, the first bit of the gamma rate is [0m1[0m.

[0mThe
most common second bit of the numbers in the diagnostic report is [0m0[0m, so
the second bit of the gamma rate is [0m0[0m.

[0mThe most common value of the third,
fourth, and fifth bits are [0m1[0m, [0m1[0m, and [0m0[0m, respectively, and so the final
three bits of the gamma rate are [0m110[0m.

[0mSo, the gamma rate is the binary
number [0m10110[0m, or [0m[1;32m22[0m[0m in decimal.

[0mThe epsilon rate is calculated in a similar
way; rather than use the most common bit, the least common bit from each
position is used. So, the epsilon rate is [0m01001[0m, or [0m[1;32m9[0m[0m in decimal. Multiplying
the gamma rate ([0m22[0m) by the epsilon rate ([0m9[0m) produces the power consumption,
[0m[1;32m198[0m[0m.

[0mUse the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the
gamma rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together. [1;32mWhat is the power
consumption of the submarine?[0m (Be sure to represent your answer in decimal,
not binary.)
