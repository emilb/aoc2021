[1;31m--- Day 12: Passage Pathing ---
[0mWith your [0msubmarine's subterranean subsystems subsisting suboptimally[0m,
the only way you're getting out of this cave anytime soon is by finding
a path yourself. Not just [1;32ma[0m path - the only way to know if you've found
the [1;32mbest[0m path is to find [1;32mall[0m of them.

[0mFortunately, the sensors are still
mostly working, and so you build a rough map of the remaining caves (your
puzzle input). For example:

[0m[0mstart-A
start-b
A-c
A-b
b-d
A-end
b-end
[0m[0m
[0mThis
is a list of how all of the caves are connected. You start in the cave
named [0mstart[0m, and your destination is the cave named [0mend[0m. An entry like
[0mb-d[0m means that cave [0mb[0m is connected to cave [0md[0m - that is, you can move between
them.

[0mSo, the above cave system looks roughly like this:

[0m[0m    start
   
/   \
c--A-----b--d
    \   /
     end
[0m[0m
[0mYour goal is to find the number
of distinct [1;32mpaths[0m that start at [0mstart[0m, end at [0mend[0m, and don't visit small
caves more than once. There are two types of caves: [1;32mbig[0m caves (written
in uppercase, like [0mA[0m) and [1;32msmall[0m caves (written in lowercase, like [0mb[0m). It
would be a waste of time to visit any small cave more than once, but big
caves are large enough that it might be worth visiting them multiple times.
So, all paths you find should [1;32mvisit small caves at most once[0m, and can [1;32mvisit
big caves any number of times[0m.

[0mGiven these rules, there are [0m[1;32m10[0m[0m paths through
this example cave system:

[0m[0mstart,A,b,A,c,A,end
start,A,b,A,end
start,A,b,end
start,A,c,A,b,A,end
start,A,c,A,b,end
start,A,c,A,end
start,A,end
start,b,A,c,A,end
start,b,A,end
start,b,end
[0m[0m
[0m(Each
line in the above list corresponds to a single path; the caves visited
by that path are listed in the order they are visited and separated by
commas.)

[0mNote that in this cave system, cave [0md[0m is never visited by any
path: to do so, cave [0mb[0m would need to be visited twice (once on the way
to cave [0md[0m and a second time when returning from cave [0md[0m), and since cave
[0mb[0m is small, this is not allowed.

[0mHere is a slightly larger example:

[0m[0mdc-end
HN-start
start-kj
dc-start
dc-HN
LN-dc
HN-end
kj-sa
kj-HN
kj-dc
[0m[0m
[0mThe
[0m19[0m paths through it are as follows:

[0m[0mstart,HN,dc,HN,end
start,HN,dc,HN,kj,HN,end
start,HN,dc,end
