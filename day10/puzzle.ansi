[1;31m--- Day 10: Syntax Scoring ---
[0mYou ask the submarine to determine the best route out of the deep-sea cave,
but it only replies:

[0m[0mSyntax error in navigation subsystem on line: [0mall
of them[0m[0m[0m
[0m[1;32mAll of them?![0m The damage is worse than you thought. You bring up
a copy of the navigation subsystem (your puzzle input).

[0mThe navigation
subsystem syntax is made of several lines containing [1;32mchunks[0m. There are
one or more chunks on each line, and chunks contain zero or more other
chunks. Adjacent chunks are not separated by any delimiter; if one chunk
stops, the next chunk (if any) can immediately start. Every chunk must
[1;32mopen[0m and [1;32mclose[0m with one of four legal pairs of matching characters:

[0m
[0mIf
a chunk opens with [0m([0m, it must close with [0m)[0m.[0m
[0mIf a chunk opens with [0m[[0m, it
must close with [0m][0m.[0m
[0mIf a chunk opens with [0m{[0m, it must close with [0m}[0m.[0m
[0mIf a
chunk opens with [0m&lt;[0m, it must close with [0m&gt;[0m.[0m
[0m
[0mSo, [0m()[0m is a legal chunk
that contains no other chunks, as is [0m[][0m. More complex but valid chunks
include [0m([])[0m, [0m{()()()}[0m, [0m&lt;([{}])&gt;[0m, [0m[&lt;&gt;({}){}[([])&lt;&gt;]][0m,
and even [0m(((((((((())))))))))[0m.

[0mSome lines are [1;32mincomplete[0m, but others are
[1;32mcorrupted[0m. Find and discard the corrupted lines first.

[0mA corrupted line
is one where a chunk [1;32mcloses with the wrong character[0m - that is, where the
characters it opens and closes with do not form one of the four legal pairs
listed above.

[0mExamples of corrupted chunks include [0m(][0m, [0m{()()()&gt;[0m, [0m(((()))}[0m,
and [0m&lt;([]){()}[{}])[0m. Such a chunk can appear anywhere within a line,
and its presence causes the whole line to be considered corrupted.

[0mFor
example, consider the following navigation subsystem:

[0m[0m[({(&lt;(())[]&gt;[[{[]{&lt;()&lt;&gt;&gt;
[(()[&lt;&gt;])]({[&lt;{&lt;&lt;[]&gt;&gt;(
{([(&lt;{}[&lt;&gt;[]}&gt;{[]{[(&lt;()&gt;
(((({&lt;&gt;}&lt;{&lt;{&lt;&gt;}{[]{[]{}
[[&lt;[([]))&lt;([[{}[[()]]]
[{[{({}]{}}([{[{{{}}([]
{&lt;[[]]&gt;}&lt;{[{[{[]{()[[[]
[&lt;(&lt;(&lt;(&lt;{}))&gt;&lt;([]([]()
&lt;{([([[(&lt;&gt;()){}]&gt;(&lt;&lt;{{
&lt;{([{{}}[&lt;[[[&lt;&gt;{}]]]&gt;[]]
[0m[0m
[0mSome
of the lines aren't corrupted, just incomplete; you can ignore these lines
for now. The remaining five lines are corrupted:

[0m
[0m[0m{([(&lt;{}[&lt;&gt;[]}&gt;{[]{[(&lt;()&gt;[0m
- Expected [0m][0m, but found [0m}[0m instead.[0m
[0m[0m[[&lt;[([]))&lt;([[{}[[()]]][0m - Expected
[0m][0m, but found [0m)[0m instead.[0m
[0m[0m[{[{({}]{}}([{[{{{}}([][0m - Expected [0m)[0m, but found
[0m][0m instead.[0m
[0m[0m[&lt;(&lt;(&lt;(&lt;{}))&gt;&lt;([]([]()[0m - Expected [0m&gt;[0m, but
found [0m)[0m instead.[0m
[0m[0m&lt;{([([[(&lt;&gt;()){}]&gt;(&lt;&lt;{{[0m - Expected [0m][0m,
but found [0m&gt;[0m instead.[0m
[0m
[0mStop at the first incorrect closing character
on each corrupted line.

[0mDid you know that syntax checkers actually have
contests to see who can get the high score for syntax errors in a file?
It's true! To calculate the syntax error score for a line, take the [1;32mfirst
illegal character[0m on the line and look it up in the following table:

[0m
[0m[0m)[0m:
[0m3[0m points.[0m
[0m[0m][0m: [0m57[0m points.[0m
[0m[0m}[0m: [0m1197[0m points.[0m
[0m[0m&gt;[0m: [0m25137[0m points.[0m
[0m
[0mIn the above
example, an illegal [0m)[0m was found twice ([0m2*3 = [1;32m6[0m[0m points), an illegal [0m][0m was
found once ([0m[1;32m57[0m[0m points), an illegal [0m}[0m was found once ([0m[1;32m1197[0m[0m points), and
an illegal [0m&gt;[0m was found once ([0m[1;32m25137[0m[0m points). So, the total syntax error
score for this file is [0m6+57+1197+25137 = [1;32m26397[0m[0m points!

[0mFind the first illegal
character in each corrupted line of the navigation subsystem. [1;32mWhat is the
total syntax error score for those errors?[0m
