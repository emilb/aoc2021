[1;31m--- Day 8: Seven Segment Search ---
[0mYou barely reach the safety of the cave when the whale smashes into the
cave mouth, collapsing it. Sensors indicate another exit to this cave at
a much greater depth, so you have no choice but to press on.

[0mAs your submarine
slowly makes its way through the cave system, you notice that the four-digit
[0mseven-segment displays[0m in your submarine are malfunctioning; [0mthey must
have been damaged[0m during the escape. You'll be in a lot of trouble without
them, so you'd better figure out what's wrong.

[0mEach digit of a seven-segment
display is rendered by turning on or off any of seven segments named [0ma[0m
through [0mg[0m:

[0mSo, to render a [0m1[0m,
only segments [0mc[0m and [0mf[0m would be turned on; the rest would be off. To render
a [0m7[0m, only segments [0ma[0m, [0mc[0m, and [0mf[0m would be turned on.

[0mThe problem is that
the signals which control the segments have been mixed up on each display.
The submarine is still trying to display numbers by producing output on
signal wires [0ma[0m through [0mg[0m, but those wires are connected to segments [1;32mrandomly[0m.
Worse, the wire/segment connections are mixed up separately for each four-digit
display! (All of the digits [1;32mwithin[0m a display use the same connections,
though.)

[0mSo, you might know that only signal wires [0mb[0m and [0mg[0m are turned on,
but that doesn't mean [1;32msegments[0m [0mb[0m and [0mg[0m are turned on: the only digit that
uses two segments is [0m1[0m, so it must mean segments [0mc[0m and [0mf[0m are meant to be
on. With just that information, you still can't tell which wire ([0mb[0m/[0mg[0m) goes
to which segment ([0mc[0m/[0mf[0m). For that, you'll need to collect more information.

[0mFor
each display, you watch the changing signals for a while, make a note of
[1;32mall ten unique signal patterns[0m you see, and then write down a single [1;32mfour
digit output value[0m (your puzzle input). Using the signal patterns, you
should be able to work out which pattern corresponds to which digit.

[0mFor
example, here is what you might see in a single entry in your notes:

[0m[0macedgfb
cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab |
cdfeb fcadb cdfeb
cdbaf[0m[0m
[0m(The entry is wrapped here to two lines so it fits; in your notes,
it will all be on a single line.)

[0mEach entry consists of ten [1;32munique signal
patterns[0m, a [0m|[0m delimiter, and finally the [1;32mfour digit output value[0m. Within
an entry, the same wire/segment connections are used (but you don't know
what the connections actually are). The unique signal patterns correspond
to the ten different ways the submarine tries to render a digit using the
current wire/segment connections. Because [0m7[0m is the only digit that uses
three segments, [0mdab[0m in the above example means that to render a [0m7[0m, signal
lines [0md[0m, [0ma[0m, and [0mb[0m are on. Because [0m4[0m is the only digit that uses four segments,
[0meafb[0m means that to render a [0m4[0m, signal lines [0me[0m, [0ma[0m, [0mf[0m, and [0mb[0m are on.

[0mUsing
this information, you should be able to work out which combination of signal
wires corresponds to each of the ten digits. Then, you can decode the four
digit output value. Unfortunately, in the above example, all of the digits
in the output value ([0mcdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf[0m) use five segments and are
more difficult to deduce.

[0mFor now, [1;32mfocus on the easy digits[0m. Consider this
larger example:

[0mBecause the digits [0m1[0m, [0m4[0m, [0m7[0m,
and [0m8[0m each use a unique number of segments, you should be able to tell
which combinations of signals correspond to those digits. Counting [1;32monly
digits in the output values[0m (the part after [0m|[0m on each line), in the above
example, there are [0m[1;32m26[0m[0m instances of digits that use a unique number of segments
(highlighted above).

[0m[1;32mIn the output values, how many times do digits [0m1[0m,
[0m4[0m, [0m7[0m, or [0m8[0m appear?[0m
