[1;31m--- Day 15: Chiton ---
[0mYou've almost reached the exit of the cave, but the walls are getting closer
together. Your submarine can barely still fit, though; the main problem
is that the walls of the cave are covered in [0mchitons[0m, and it would be best
not to bump any of them.

[0mThe cavern is large, but has a very low ceiling,
restricting your motion to two dimensions. The shape of the cavern resembles
a square; a quick scan of chiton density produces a map of [1;32mrisk level[0m throughout
the cave (your puzzle input). For example:

[0mYou
start in the top left position, your destination is the bottom right position,
and you [0mcannot move diagonally[0m. The number at each position is its [1;32mrisk
level[0m; to determine the total risk of an entire path, add up the risk levels
of each position you [1;32menter[0m (that is, don't count the risk level of your
starting position unless you enter it; leaving it adds no risk to your
total).

[0mYour goal is to find a path with the [1;32mlowest total risk[0m. In this
example, a path with the lowest total risk is highlighted here:

[0mThe
total risk of this path is [0m[1;32m40[0m[0m (the starting position is never entered,
so its risk is not counted).
