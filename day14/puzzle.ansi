[1;31m--- Day 14: Extended Polymerization ---
[0mThe incredible pressures at this depth are starting to put a strain on
your submarine. The submarine has [0mpolymerization[0m equipment that would produce
suitable materials to reinforce the submarine, and the nearby volcanically-active
caves should even have the necessary input elements in sufficient quantities.

[0mThe
submarine manual contains [0minstructions[0m for finding the optimal polymer
formula; specifically, it offers a [1;32mpolymer template[0m and a list of [1;32mpair
insertion[0m rules (your puzzle input). You just need to work out what polymer
would result after repeating the pair insertion process a few times.

[0mFor
example:

[0m[0m
[0mThe first line is the [1;32mpolymer
template[0m - this is the starting point of the process.

[0mThe following section
defines the [1;32mpair insertion[0m rules. A rule like [0mAB -&gt; C[0m means that when
elements [0mA[0m and [0mB[0m are immediately adjacent, element [0mC[0m should be inserted
between them. These insertions all happen simultaneously.

[0mSo, starting
with the polymer template [0mNNCB[0m, the first step simultaneously considers
all three pairs:

[0m
[0mThe first pair ([0mNN[0m) matches the rule [0mNN -&gt; C[0m, so element
[0m[1;32mC[0m[0m is inserted between the first [0mN[0m and the second [0mN[0m.[0m
[0mThe second pair ([0mNC[0m)
matches the rule [0mNC -&gt; B[0m, so element [0m[1;32mB[0m[0m is inserted between the [0mN[0m and
the [0mC[0m.[0m
[0mThe third pair ([0mCB[0m) matches the rule [0mCB -&gt; H[0m, so element [0m[1;32mH[0m[0m is
inserted between the [0mC[0m and the [0mB[0m.[0m
[0m
[0mNote that these pairs overlap: the second
element of one pair is the first element of the next pair. Also, because
all pairs are considered simultaneously, inserted elements are not considered
to be part of a pair until the next step.

[0mAfter the first step of this
process, the polymer becomes [0mN[1;32mC[0mN[1;32mB[0mC[1;32mH[0mB[0m.

[0mHere are the results of a few steps
using the above rules:

[0m[0mTemplate:     NNCB
After step 1: NCNBCHB
After step
2: NBCCNBBBCBHCB
After step 3: NBBBCNCCNBBNBNBBCHBHHBCHB
After step 4:

[0m[0m
[0mThis polymer grows quickly.
After step 5, it has length 97; After step 10, it has length 3073. After
step 10, [0mB[0m occurs 1749 times, [0mC[0m occurs 298 times, [0mH[0m occurs 161 times, and
[0mN[0m occurs 865 times; taking the quantity of the most common element ([0mB[0m,
1749) and subtracting the quantity of the least common element ([0mH[0m, 161)
produces [0m1749 - 161 = [1;32m1588[0m[0m.

[0mApply 10 steps of pair insertion to the polymer
template and find the most and least common elements in the result. [1;32mWhat
do you get if you take the quantity of the most common element and subtract
the quantity of the least common element?[0m
